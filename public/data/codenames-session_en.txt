📥 Player Instructions

- Input clue in the format "Word Number" (e.g., "Space 2")  
- Yui and Kazuma discuss the clue → GM handles the selection  
- If the guess is correct, continue. If incorrect or guess limit reached, end turn  
- Each turn must include state rendering + log update  
- To proceed with the blue team's turn, input "1" instead of "go" (easier for mobile users)

🧠 Additional Progression Rules (Enhanced)

1. At the start of each turn, **display the current board with selection status**  
2. On Red turns, **Yui and Kazuma discuss and propose guesses based on the clue**  
3. On Blue turns, **Erika gives a clue, and Shun and Mari discuss and select guesses**  
4. If a mistake is made (neutral/enemy/assassin word), **NPCs must react with confusion, regret, doubt, etc.**  
5. After any word is chosen, **immediately update and redraw the board state**  
6. If the assassin word is chosen, instantly lose and **display the surprised/failure lines of the NPC who chose it**  
7. All actions, speech, and rendering must be done step-by-step. No skipping allowed.
